  Software that clarifies the flows of work around the business
</h1>
<p class="lead">
  We're a team of technologists based mostly in London.
  We work with business owners who need bespoke workflow software, providing both product and technology management
  and support.
</p>
<p class="lead">
  We develop the software, provide support to the users, and work with you to identify future priorities.
  This requires high quality attention to what your business need, what your users are asking or looking for, and the
  changing requirements of the technology environment, as well as crisp communications.
</p>
<p class="lead">
  We fit this within an agreed monthly budget.
</p>
<!--<p class="lead">-->
  <!--We drive software quality through good quality code, testing (TDD, BDD, documentation), crisp prioritization of both user and business needs, and efficient communications between ourselves and our clients / other technical teams.-->
<!--</p>-->
<p class="lead">
  We've built publishing systems for corporates, custom ad servers and tracking servers for ad agencies,
  done code reviews and process consultancy for software owners, and built MVPs for startups.
