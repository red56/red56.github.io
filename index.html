<h1 class="cover-heading">RED56 software agency.</h1>
<p class="lead">We're based in London and we work with technology owners who need their software to
  be supported, extended, and kept fresh, but without the costs of a full-time fully-sized team.
</p>
<p class="lead">Our main working mantra is software quality enabled through testing (TDD, BDD, documentation), crisp prioritization of both user and business needs, and efficient communications between ourselves and our clients / other technical teams.
</p>
<p class="lead">
  We've built publishing systems for corporates, custom ad servers and tracking servers for ad agencies,
  done code reviews and process consultancy for software owners, and built MVPs for startups.
</p>
<p class="lead">
  We're currently focusing on providing ongoing budget-constrained product management, software development, and support for
  business-critical bespoke software for a small number of clients.
