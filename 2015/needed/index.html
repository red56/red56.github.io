  we need some of your time
  to help out in one (or both) of two ways:
</p><p>
  1) <em>1-4 days a month (flexible, remote)</em>.<br/>Small improvements, bug fixes, device compatibility, API changes.
</p>

<p>
  2) <em>A few weeks of time (flexible, can be remote)</em><br/>to help out on particular spikes of development (e.g.

    <em>
    RED56 is a software agency based in London and we work with technology owners who need their software
    professionally product-managed, supported, and extended, and generally kept fresh, but without the costs and
    hassle of managing a full-time fully-sized inhouse team.
    </em></p>

  <p>
    <em>Our development team includes both full-time
    employees
    and a small bunch of freelancers who work with us on a regular basis. I personally write lots of web code, but
    not mobile apps.
