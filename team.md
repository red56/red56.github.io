## Our development practices

We build new features and bug fixes with automated tests (“TDD”) This ensures the expected outcome is achieved while preventing future regressions.. These tests are run every time we change your code (“continuous integration”).

We make sure your live systems have automated backups, error and performance monitoring and have a shadow “staging” system where new features can be trialled with realistic data before being pushed out to production.
