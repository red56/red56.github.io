# Workflow software

We help SMEs improve the flow of work in their business by developing, maintaining, and integrating bespoke software (and SaaS).

Key business information needs to flow fluidly, visibly and securely both within the business and externally to suppliers and customers

There are many off the shelf software products available providing generic business solutions. However sometimes, in order to maintain business edge and uniqueness, SMEs need to have a
critical part of their work reflected in a bespoke piece of software or integration.

We help SME clients who have this need by developing new software, maintaining existing software, and integrating appropriate online products via APIs.

For example we've built systems that schedule
jobs for a bespoke build-to-order manufacturer, manage complex market research projects (distributing to respondents, gathering, evaluating, and presenting as raw data to analysts and clients).

<!--
While bespoke software gives SME a distinctive edge and keeps them competitive, it can itself be a liability and
needs to be kept to a minimum and replaced or integrated with existing SaaS provision when possible.
-->

This requires a clear understanding of the direction of business, what the users are looking for,
and the changing expectations of the technology environment. That's why we recommend a [long-term engagement](roadmap#long_term), but we can start with a [single sprint](roadmap#first_sprint).
