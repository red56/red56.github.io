# Getting started

Our clients don’t necessarily start with a [long-term engagement]({% link long_term.md %}) (though you might want to work toward it: we think it’s
the most productive arrangement in the end).

Instead you probably have some pressing needs which you want to achieve with a short-term project. These quick wins - bug fixes, a simple new requirement or a security audit/improvement - help us on the path to a roadmap.

The initial project can give us an immediate insight into the current state of your software with a mini audit. This includes test coverage, 3rd party integrations, staging server, CI, error reporting and performance and may also include privacy compliance and security auditing.
