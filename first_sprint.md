# Getting started

Our clients donâ€™t necessarily start with a [long-term engagement]({% link long_term.md %}). Normally there's a pressing need which needs fixing with a short-term project. These quick wins - bug fixes, a simple new requirement or a security audit/improvement - contribute to a roadmap.

The initial project acts as a mini audit, giving us immediate insight into the current state of the software. This includes test coverage, 3rd party integrations, staging server, CI, error reporting and performance and may also include privacy compliance and security auditing.
