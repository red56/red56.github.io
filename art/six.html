<P align=right>Performance piece in development 1995/6</P>
<p> Six is a performance duet for live dancer and computer-generated choreographer being developed in collaboration with ballet choreographer Susan Crow. "Six" grew out of work we were doing at Digital Dancing, Dance Umbrella 95 at Sadlers Wells ('Techno Dance Bytes'). The point of departure and the guiding pricinple of the project's development is the investigation of the differences between developing material with a live dancer and through the computer. We  are working by stating the same material in both media and passing it backwards and forwards between us transforming it between live dancer and computer software, emphasising the specifically human possibilities and limitiations on the one hand and the specifically digital possibilities and limitations on the other.
