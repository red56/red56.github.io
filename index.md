## Red56

We're a [team of business-focused technologists]({% link team.md %}) providing product
management, technology development and support.

We [help SMEs improve the flow of work in their business]({% link bespoke_software.md%}) by developing, maintaining,
and integrating bespoke software (and SaaS).

[This works well with long term engagements]({% link long_term.md %}) as we can maximize our impact within an agreed
quarterly budget and keep the development team fresh with your codebase.

SMEs and startups employ us [to fulfil short-term immediate needs]({% link first_sprint.md %}) (bug fixes,
software audit, security patching, new business requirements, working prototypes / MVPs).

We've built publishing systems for corporates, custom ad servers and tracking servers for ad agencies, done code
reviews and process consultancy for software owners, and built MVPs for startups.  [What can we do for you?]({% link
