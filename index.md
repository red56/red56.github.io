## What we do

We're a team of business-focused technologists based mostly in London, providing product management, technology development and support.

We help SMEs improve the flow of work within their business and externally with suppliers and customers. We do this by developing new software, maintaining existing software, and integrating appropriate online products via APIs.

This requires a clear understanding of the direction the business is going towards, what the are looking for, and the changing expectations of the technology environment.

This works best with long term engagements as we can then maximizing our impact within an agreed quarterly budget. However it often starts with us fulfilling a short-term immediate need (bug fixes, software audit, security patching, addressing unfulfilled business need).

We've built publishing systems for corporates, custom ad servers and tracking servers for ad agencies, done code reviews and process consultancy for software owners, and built MVPs for startups.
