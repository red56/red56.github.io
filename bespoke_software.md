# Bespoke software for SMEs

We help SMEs improve the flow of work in their business by developing, maintaining, and integrating bespoke and SaaS software.

Work needs to flow fluidly, visibly and securely both within their business and externally with suppliers and
customers.

Sometimes there is already a Software as a Service (SaaS or "Cloud service") available to help -- particularly for
generic business tools. However in order to maintain business edge and uniqueness, SMEs often need to have some
critical part of the work reflected in a bespoke piece of software or integration. For example, the scheduling of
jobs for a bespoke build-to-order manufacturer, the management of market research (distributing to respondents,
gathering, evaluating, and presenting as raw data to analysts and clients).

<!--
While bespoke software gives SME a distinctive edge and keeps them competitive, it can itself be a liability and
needs to be kept to a minimum and replaced or integrated with existing SaaS provision when possible.
-->

We help SME clients who have this by developing new software, maintaining existing software, and integrating
appropriate online products via APIs.

This requires a clear understanding of the direction the business is going towards, what the users are looking for,
and the changing expectations of the technology environment. That's why we recommend a [long-term engagement]({% link
 long_term.md %}), but we can start with a [single sprint]({% link first_sprint.md %}).
