## Long-term engagements

We work with clients to define a product roadmap based on their current needs and medium to long-term business plans.

Time is then spent attending to and developing the product within an agreed quarterly budget.

Clients have access to a support system where new features can be requested as they come to mind and bugs reported. This contributes to the product roadmap, building a complete picture of the software's requirements.

We catch up with clients regulary to plan short-bursts of development (sprints). Priorities are identified using the roadmap and requests submitted via our support.

Each sprint is broken into:

* Providing answers to support requests
* Fixing any bugs/technical issues that arise
* Implementing minor changes to reduce the need for support
* Developing and releasing agreed features to deliver business goals
* Upgrading technical libraries and integrations

The sprint always results in multiple updates to a staging (test) application and at least one update (deployment) to the live application.
