## How we support clients in long-term commitments

You define a quarterly budget and we’ll spend the agreed time attending to and developing the product to
meet your business needs..

We work together to define a product roadmap based on current needs and medium to long-term business plans.

You’ll be given access to our support system so you can easily request new features as they come to mind and report bugs. This contributes to the product roadmap, building a complete picture of your software requirements.

Using the roadmap and requests submitted via our support system we identify priorities and plan short-bursts of development (sprints) to make changes to the software.

The time of each sprint is broken into the following priorities:

* Providing answers to support requests
* Fixing any bugs/technical issues that arise
* Implementing minor changes to reduce the need for support
* Developing and releasing agreed features to deliver business goals
* Upgrading technical libraries and integrations

The sprint always results in multiple updates to a staging (test) application and at least one update (deployment) to your live application.
